# Scoring System

An HTTP API for tracking scores from external goal-watching devices
(sensors, cameras, referee tablets, ESP32s, etc.). Scoring detection is
the responsibility of the devices — they send events, and the server
translates them into points.

## Modes

- **Free play (default):** a 30-second sliding window shows a rolling
  count of recent scores. Events age out automatically. Recent scoring
  batches are also tracked for display.
- **Match mode:** scores accumulate from zero with per-phase breakdowns.
  Automatically activates when a match starts and returns to free play
  when the match clears.

## Key Concepts

- **Elements** — configurable scoring types (e.g. "speaker", "amp",
  "foul") with point values, optional phase restrictions, and
  deduplication windows.
- **Sources** — each device identifies itself; the server tracks health
  and event counts per source.
- **Deduplication** — when multiple sensors watch the same goal, events
  for the same element and alliance within a configurable window merge
  into one.
- **Fouls** — elements with `awardToOpponent: true` give points to the
  opposing alliance.
- **Phase restrictions** — elements can be limited to specific match
  phases (e.g. auto-only bonuses). A grace window (default 5 s,
  configurable as `phaseGraceSeconds`) attributes events arriving just
  after a phase change to the previous phase.
- **Auto-registration** — unknown element names in incoming events are
  auto-created (1 point each) up to `SCORING_AUTO_REGISTER_LIMIT`
  (default 1); beyond the limit they're rejected as `unknown_element`.
  Set the limit to `0` to require explicit configuration.
- **Goal-active shift scoring (REBUILT)** — in match mode, events scored
  while the alliance's goal is inactive during teleop shifts don't count
  toward the match total (with a 3 s grace around shift boundaries).
  Match scores break down by period: auto, transition, shifts 1–4, and
  endgame.

## Quick Start for a Scoring Device

```
POST /api/score?key=YOUR_KEY HTTP/1.1
Host: pfms.local:3000
Content-Type: application/json

{"source":"goal-1","alliance":"red","element":"speaker"}
```

Multiple events can be submitted in one request; a batch that partially
succeeds returns HTTP 207 with per-event results.

### Authentication

Via `X-API-Key` header or `?key=` query parameter. API keys are managed
through the admin panel at `/admin`. Once a key is created, authentication
is required for write endpoints. Unrecognized devices appear as "pending"
in the admin panel for one-click approval.

> **Open until the first key exists.** Until you create a key, the scoring
> API accepts writes from **any device on the network** — submitting
> scores, resetting them, and replacing the element configuration. That's
> deliberate: a new sensor works with no setup at all.
>
> Two ways to close it:
>
> - **Create an API key** in `/admin`. From then on writes need a key, and
>   unrecognized devices show up as pending for one-click approval.
> - **Set `SCORING_REQUIRE_KEY=true`** to refuse unauthenticated writes
>   outright, including before any key exists — so there's no open window
>   at all on first boot.
>
> The setup screen reports which mode the field is in, so you can verify it
> rather than assume. See the
> [security model](support.md#security-model--read-this-before-opening-a-field).

## Endpoints

| Endpoint             | Method | Auth     | Description                                                                                    |
| -------------------- | ------ | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/api/score`         | POST   | Required | Submit score event(s); 207 on partial batch success                                            |
| `/api/score`         | GET    | None     | Get current score state                                                                        |
| `/api/score/reset`   | POST   | Required | Reset all scores                                                                               |
| `/api/score/config`  | GET    | None     | Get element configuration                                                                      |
| `/api/score/config`  | PUT    | Required | Replace element configuration                                                                  |
| `/api/score/mode`    | PUT    | Required | Set mode, sliding window size, `autoRegisterLimit`, `phaseGraceSeconds`, `batchTimeoutSeconds` |
| `/api/score/sources` | GET    | None     | List scoring sources and their status                                                          |
| `/api/score/schema`  | GET    | None     | Machine-readable API schema                                                                    |

Full API documentation is served at `GET /api/score/schema` as an
[OpenAPI 3.1.0](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.1.0) spec in JSON. Point
any OpenAPI-compatible tool (Swagger UI, Redoc, code generators) at it, or
read it directly from tiny devices.

Score state is also broadcast in real time to all WebSocket clients as
`scoreState` messages, and read-only to scoreboard clients on the
`/ws/scores` WebSocket path (no auth — it backs the public `/scores`
page).

## Match Review

Recorded matches (see [match history](match-system.md#match-history)) can
be re-scored after the fact — e.g. from a video review station:

| Endpoint                      | Method | Auth     | Description                                       |
| ----------------------------- | ------ | -------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `/api/match-review`           | POST   | Required | Submit reviewed scores for a match (per alliance) |
| `/api/match-review/recording` | POST   | Required | Register a review-page URL for a match            |
| `/api/match-review/matches`   | GET    | None     | List recorded matches for reconciliation          |

Reviewed values override the live sensor counts in match history, and the
`/match` page highlights disagreements between the two.
